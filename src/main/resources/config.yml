# --- StupidWarp Configuration ---

# Supports MiniMessage formatting for advanced text styling.
# Use the MiniMessage WebUI (https://webui.advntr.dev/) to create custom formatted messages.
# Important: Avoid using legacy color codes ('§', '&') within these messages, as they are incompatible.
# Note: Legacy color codes are ONLY supported in the 'time-format' option.

# Prefix for all messages sent by the plugin.
prefix: "<light_purple>Stupid</light_purple><aqua>Warp</aqua> <gray>|</gray> "

# Date and time format displayed on hover.
# Uses Java's DateTimeFormatter patterns.
# See: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html
# Example: '§a'dd'§7'.'§a'MM'§7'.'§a'yyyy '§a'HH'§7':'§a'mm  will result in something like: 24.10.2023 15:30
time-format: "'§a'dd'§7'.'§a'MM'§7'.'§a'yyyy '§a'HH'§7':'§a'mm"
